// Syntax Parser - a program that interpets your code and determines what it does and if the syntx is valid
// Lexical Environment - where something sits physically in the code you write 
// Execution Context - a wrapper to help manage the code that is running 
// When the Exectuion Context is created by the Javascript engine, it creates the global object(The browser window) and the value "this"
// Global means not inside the Function
// This is the same as the global context
// The extecution conext is created in two phases the Creation Phase which creates the Global Objext, "this", "Outer Environment",
//  and memory space for variables and functions
// The second phase of the excution context is the Execution is exection phase
// Single-Threader means one command line excuted at a 
// Synchronous means one at time and in order
// Variable Enviroment - where the variable lives 
// NOTE: That every Exectuion context has it's own variable environment 
// Scope is where a vaiable is avaible in your code and if it's truly the same variable or a new copy
// Namespace - a container for variables and functions
// First Class Functions = you can treat functions as you can would any other objects
// Expression: a unit of code that results in a value
